Dark theme for Windows 11


Download and install the ConceptzXDark.theme file to Windows 11


Inspired by Trade Your Plan's youtube video for adding a dark theme to Windows 11 for Sierra Chart, should have the correct settings out of the box. 

Feel free to fork and send a pull request if you think you can improve the color pallate.
Needs some work with padding, invisible borders overlap text at times.
